# EvenniaGames
Just a Giant repository of random games I coded in evennia. They're basically repositories of system specific customizations in evennia.

# What's here?
* FSuns - Fading Suns in Evennia

# Note
Please don't use these whole sale. You should make a new evennia --init folder and then copy and paste the code. 
If there are settings that need to be added to settings.py each system will tell you in that folder.
Don't reuse the secret key that shows up in the github for testing.
